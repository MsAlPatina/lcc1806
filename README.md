# LCC1806
The LCC1806 is a project made by [NULLderef](https://github.com/0xNULLderef) and me with the intent of making the [LCC1802](https://github.com/bill2009/lcc1802) be easier to use in linux aswell as improving it.

# Installation
Download the [make_toolchain.sh](https://github.com/MsAlPatina/lcc1806/blob/main/make_toolchain.sh) into a folder somewhere (like in your home directory, so: /home/username/lccorwhatever) and it will build the compiler!
Additionally you can drag a folder like the [SBC1806](https://github.com/MsAlPatina/lcc1806/tree/main/sbc1806) onto the folder of the compiler to have target specific libraries (or any other target)
The provided makefile has as its target the SBC1806
